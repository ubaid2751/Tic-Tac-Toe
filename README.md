# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Pygame library. The game offers two modes: Player vs Player, where two players can compete against each other on the same computer, and Player vs AI, where a player can challenge a simple AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm for decision-making.
